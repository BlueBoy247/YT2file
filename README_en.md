[繁體中文](./README.md) | English

A open source portable software that can download YouTube videos in high resolution for free.

## Origin
Although there are many websites and apps available online for downloading YouTube videos, some of them contain malware, some have too many ads that affect user operations, and others require payment to download high-resolution videos. Based on these inconveniences encountered in daily life, I chose to made a YouTube Video Downloader as my self-directed learning project for the second semester of the 110th academic year. After that, I extended it based on the outcome of that project to develop this open source software.
